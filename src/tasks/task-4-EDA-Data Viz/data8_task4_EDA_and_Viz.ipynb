# Summary Documentation

1. Importing all required packages
2. Reading csv file
3. Checking the row count and column count
4. Checking the info of dataframe

*We will get to know about the datatyes of each column that we will be converting to our requirement accordingly in below codes*

5. Removing extra characters from raised column

*We have to remove all sign so that we can use numbers for analysis*


6. Converted raised to numeric
7. Getting the boxplot to check the variance and outliers
8. Converting range of employees to numeric
9. Checking the Null values, here white part represents the NULL

*We do not have to remove null values here because they are very less and most of the column are having the values.*


10. Checking Raised vs employees

*In the below graph you can see that company having employee 501-100 have raised most capital.*


11. Getting a heatmap to get the correlation
12. Plotted names of startups in descending order of raised capital

*Pinterest and Lendup have raised good amount of capital.*

13. Locations where more number of startups are there (Top 10).

*San francisco has highest number of startups and NY is second highest.*
