The mission of Ad Fontes Media is “to make news consumers smarter and news media better.”

Ad Fontes rates the news for reliability and bias to help people navigate the news landscape. Ad Fontes is Latin for “to the source,” because at the heart of what Ad Fontes Media does is look at the source—analyze the very content itself—to rate it. Ad Fontes has created a system of news content ratings that has beneficial applications for all stakeholders in a healthy news media landscape, including consumers, educators, journalism outlets, researchers, advertisers, and social media platforms. Ad Fontes currently creates ratings with a small team of human analysts who have political views from across the spectrum. The analysts are trained to look at the content of the news and score it according to a consistent methodology. Ad Fontes provides the news source ratings themselves as a reference product for consumers and educators—mainly through through its widely known Media Bias Chart. Ad Fontes also now offers a software platform for educators to teach students how to rate the news using its approach.


Ad Fontes Media is incorporated as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in Colorado. The stated public benefit of Ad Fontes Media is the same as its mission. It is currently funded by its founder, by a crowdfunding campaign which ran in late 2018,  by sales of licenses, prints, data products, and educational products, and by donations (non-tax-deductible) by individuals who believe in its mission.",Software-2018,ad fontes medium public benefit corporation rate news founded vanessa otero creator medium bias chart®,"['ad', 'font', '##es', 'medium', 'public', 'benefit', 'corporation', 'rate', 'news', 'founded', 'van', '##ess', '##a', 'o', '##tero', 'creator', 'medium', 'bias', 'chart', '##®']"

The tool lets repair and maintenance professionals perform critical tasks, send bids, and collect payments, etc. It promotes these service providers as differentiated individuals, helping build long-term relationships with clients.

It also permits property managers, landlords, and homeowners with an opportunity to post their repair and maintenance needs, and optionally, the budget within which they’re working. This streamlines the match-making process for both parties.

Customers and providers are each unique; they are not interchangeable commodities as with Lyft or Uber. Each person brings unique expertise, needs, and viewpoints to the transaction and the relationship. Our market network is designed to acknowledge that as a core tenet and provide solutions that accommodate it. The company’s mission is to expand globally while seamlessly connecting property owners with contractors. The result is more accessible talent, affordable rates, a single source for the endless needs of property owners, and more business for contractors.

Robots have always been one of the greatest dreams and fears of people. We marvel at their capabilities, yet are terrified of what they can become. We want them to be intelligent, yet are constantly disappointed. We saw this paradox and thought what can we do differently?

Using our backgrounds in engineering and design, we saw that we can use a thoughtful and people-first approach to making robots. Robots should work with people rather than do things only on their own. This relationship between person and robot should be one that’s constructive.

When we were looking at where to call Coral home, it was important to us that it be a place filled with creativity, energy, and next to the ocean. We wanted to be in a place where we can foster talent and spark innovation. We wanted to be in a place where we can be reminded of the values of our brand. More importantly, we wanted to build a community of people who use design and robotics to empower people. That’s why Los Angeles is our home.

We think robotics is an innovative and exciting space. We see a future with an ecosystem of robots that work together to help people in their daily lives. It’s important for us that we need to use thoughtful design to help get us to that future now.",Software-2018,coral humancentric robotics company designing robot people enhance everyday life,"['coral', 'human', '##centric', 'robotic', '##s', 'company', 'designing', 'robot', 'people', 'enhance', 'everyday', 'life']"

Corsha has developed the first and only dynamic, fully automated multi-factor authentication (MFA) for APIs.  We protect APIs using the same MFA principles that have successfully protected systems from human username/password cyberattacks.

By enabling MFA for every API call, our platform cryptographically defines the network so that only authorized machines can connect to applications and data, resulting in a dynamic identity for every deployed machine.  

Through our central management console, security professionals have full visibility into and complete control of all API activity across cloud and enterprise networks.

What if that one missed call is your most loyal client and because they couldn’t reach you they changed services? Don’t take that chance! They provide phone coverage 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Their staff is comprised of tenured agents with a passion for customer service and will represent your business with the professionalism it deserves. Staffing issues? Emergency? Language barriers? No problem. Coverage, both English and Spanish, is always available even when life throws you a curve ball such as a sick employee or natural disaster such as a hurricane.  Think you can’t afford it? Think again! An average, entry level, 40 hour a week receptionist makes roughly $23000 a year plus the cost of hiring, training, insurance, and benefits. Depending on your call volume, their answering service runs about $400-$1000 a month with none of the other fees!

Our flagship product, the MIMIR Blockchain to Internet (B2i) Bridge, brings blockchain to the “off-chained” by allowing direct access to the Decentralized Application ecosystem from any web connected device without the need for third-party trust; with limited or, in some cases, no pre-installed software necessary.

By leveraging existing nodes, the MIMIR Bridge can help B2B and B2C clients improve economics and smooth capacity issues. This innovative approach will also address current issues with blockchain (namely security, scalability, and accessibility).

The MIMIR B2i Token, the value mechanism behind the MIMIR B2i Bridge solution, will go beyond the cloud and traditional Blockchain as a Service (Baas) offerings. Our token is truly the first of its kind. In exchange for cryptocurrency, users will be given a small amount of MIMIR B2i tokens that will act as its own piece of infrastructure. Thus our B2I tokens, which can be used to actively participate on the network, become a steady source of revenue for holders.
	
While there is potential for penetration of the business to consumer (B2C) market, MIMIR sees business to business (B2B) as a larger market for growth (Frost & Sullivan, estimates best B2B e-commerce is set to reach $6.7 trillion by 2020). MIMIR is actively pursuing case study partners with Dapp developers and web API’S. These markets are in need of infrastructure solutions to satisfy the demand for nodes, which presently out-paces supply by an internal estimates of 48,248%. 

We believe our B2i technology can be seen in many areas of modern business, including but not limited to:

Identity Protection 
Car sharing 
Augmented Reality 
Business Preservation/Expansion
Asset Tracking/Supply Chain (Natural Disaster Relief/Humanitarian Efforts)

high-yielding assets may be the sweet spot in the credit investment space as these types
of assets may outperform through a much overdue downturn. A firm with the right expertise
in real estate, credit modeling, and application development can position itself to capture this
opportunity.

These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) Low rates and flat yield curves, which indicate that the market may not be
compensating investors for moving out the maturity spectrum. (2) A re-levered consumer base that may not be able to meet their financial obligations
and may therefore change spending behavior. (3) Punitive regulations instituted after the last financial crisis potentially making
originators, mainly banks, less apt to hold distressed assets on balance sheet. (4) A reluctance of traditional managers to engage in smaller, fragmented asset
markets that may be costly to enter.

LienIQ is that firm. We are made up of fixed income and technology professionals that are
committed to capturing unique investment opportunities in the consumer credit space.
By marrying cutting-edge, machine-learning based, financial modeling and traditional real
estate capital structure analysis with the distributed, bottom-up power of blockchain
technology, we can engage the broader investment community and democratize the rewards
from this endeavor.

Our first order of business is purchasing and working out Non-Performing Loans (NPL’s)
in the second lien mortgage space. NPL’s present a unique opportunity because they are
rising in volume, can be sourced effectively through our network, and traditional funds tend to
avoid them because are smaller in size and carry headline risk. Furthermore, they are
buttressed by home prices, which may continue to rise through the next downturn. By
researching the market, the team discovered that a rigorous, model-driven approach was
lacking and that a scale-able second lien portfolio pricing engine may provide smaller
participants a marked advantage. In response to this insight, the team created the first version
of a small-scale, proprietary lien scoring system to evaluate claims.

Our vision is to institute a best-in-class investment process for the consumer credit space
through the next downturn so we may generate dividends for our token-holders. With
improvements of our quanta-mental approach, LienIQ will solidify this competitive
advantage. We already built and used the first version of this model to evaluate ~$5MM in
second lien portfolios and purchase several individual liens. In addition, we developed similar
models for other consumer credit assets, like unsecured term loans used for pricing and
underwriting purposes. By enhancing the model suite with more relevant and timely historical
performance data, additional human capital, and an expanded sourcing network, we may be
able to not only project future cash-flows, but also the borrower order of payments across
many financial obligations. We then may be able to intelligently select, purchase, and workout
those portfolios to monetize this informational advantage and outperform other market
participants. ",software_2017,lieniq decentralizes residential nonperforming second lien analyticsbased investing,"['lie', '##ni', '##q', 'decent', '##ral', '##izes', 'residential', 'non', '##per', '##form', '##ing', 'second', 'lie', '##n', 'anal', '##ytic', '##s', '##base', '##d', 'investing']"

It’s also totally free to play, which also cuts down on the intimidation factor and makes it fan (and family) friendly. Users can select real prizes like apparel and gift cards that can be bought with in-app currency awarded to contest winners.

Gitcoin is built upon the Ethereum network, and the solidity smart contract programming language. Ethereum provides opportunities to align incentives across actors in the ecosystem. By programming rights of stakeholders directly into smart contracts, actors are incentivized to provide value, and edge cases are handled _without_ having to involve legacy legal enforcement mechanisms.

The founder of Gitcoin, Kevin Owocki, has experience as an organizer of Boulder Startup Week, Ignite Boulder, StartupCTO.io, Boulder Blockchain Meetup, and the open-source projects by trader, adblock-to-bitcoin, YouveGotETH, and ColoradoCoin. The stronger the community is, the more successful open source projects are. The stronger open source projects are, the stronger the community is.

Almost every company is gathering a lot of data and is looking for professionals who can analyze that data in order to make predictions & generate insights. Companies like Tencent are employing several thousands of data scientists who are using data and building machine learning models in order to generate predictions & make smarter decisions. Unfortunately, the demand for data scientist exceeds the supply. According to McKinsey research, there will be a shortage of 1.25 million data scientists by 2024. Quality data scientists are hard to find and expensive to employ as a single quality data scientist costs about $117,000 per year according to Glassdoor research. The data scientist has to then spend 45% of their time on model building that we believe is a very repetitive & time consuming process. On top of that, organizations that are thinking about building an in-house solution require more than 3.5 million RMB in investment & usually more than 6 months of development. 

That is why we’re building mltrons, which is predictive analytics in 5 clicks. We’re are enabling organizations to build and leverage advanced machine learning & deep learning algorithms without ever writing a single line of code or worrying about investing in infrastructure. The users just need to prepare the data and upload it into the application after which they need to tell the system what they want to predict. Then automatically, our AI engine builds the best fit model for their problems and provides them with real-time predictions and insights. 

Our AI engine is built on a robust architecture with state of the art algorithms. Our goal is to get companies from raw data to actionable predictions in the fastest way possible. Mltrons Ai engine can be connected to various data sources after which it loads the data, prepares and cleans the data, build hundreds of thousands of combinations of algorithms and then selects the best model for the problem that can be easily deployed in one click, either by using REST API, uploading new data or using our visual prediction.

Singles found themselves feeling more alone now than ever. Couples, who once stood strong during their greatest challenges, are now crumbling under the weight of the stresses the pandemic has brought. The pandemic forced us all to change how we live our lives and to think about what’s most important: the need and desire for a deeper connection with someone. 

Singles need help connecting during actual dates (because this is where dating apps fail) and couples need help starting conversations beyond work, finances, schedules and kids. So how do you form a connection and maintain it?

For singles looking to form a genuine connection on actual dates and couples looking to maintain their connection, 3rdDegree is the ice-breaking game that facilitates new levels of open communication. It’s a connection building app that takes honesty and vulnerability to create high quality conversations. It encourages face to face communication to build a connection by two people getting to ask the date questions we all want to know. Through game-like quizzes that score you based on your effort to open up, you will find out new, fun tidbits about your person. With questions that foster a deeper connection to help reveal the true essence of a person, singles can see if they truly are a good match beyond surface level and couples are motivated by the delight in unexpected discoveries of one another.

Joon helps parents track chores and allowances while kids complete quests to collect coins and level up their characters. 

In Joon, you assign “Quests” to your kids. When your kids complete their quests, they get coins and experience points that they can use to grow, customize, and care for their virtual companions (Doters). 
Quests can be anything from chores and exercising to learning and completing homework assignments -- the tasks are endless. You can help your children build good habits and discipline by making quests recurring. You can assign and easily track allowances to quests too, turning your standard chore chart into a fun, engaging game that is great for the whole family.

By creating a game around real-life chores and tasks, Joon encourages kids to complete these tasks. This saves parents from nagging and repeatedly asking their kids to do important things like chores, studying, and exercising. Better yet, Joon turns kids into self-starters where they will proactively start doing these types of tasks on their own without parents even having to assign any to them.",software_2021,mobile app transforms chore game kid absolutely love,"['mobile', 'app', 'transforms', 'ch', '##ore', 'game', 'kid', 'absolutely', 'love']"
